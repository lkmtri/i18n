## Fetch translations

[API doc](https://app.lokalise.com/api2docs/curl/#transition-list-all-translations-get)

```js
lokaliseApi.translations.list({
  project_id: project_id,
  filter_is_reviewed: 0,
  filter_lang_id: 803

Please note that if you would like to filter translations by their language, you have to provide *language ID*, not language ISO code, as it is shown in the example above!

  translation_id,
  {translation: 'updated'},
  {project_id: project_id}
);
